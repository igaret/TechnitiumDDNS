# Dynamic DNS App for Technitium DNS Server - Project Summary

## Project Overview

We've created a comprehensive Dynamic DNS application that integrates with Technitium DNS Server. This app provides:

1. **Dynamic DNS Service**: Allows users to keep their DNS records updated with changing IP addresses
2. **User Registration System**: Complete user management with registration, authentication, and profile management
3. **Payment Integration**: Subscription plans with Stripe payment processing
4. **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for managing domains and account settings

## Key Components

### 1. App.cs

The main application class that implements the required interfaces for Technitium DNS Server integration:
- `IDnsApplication`: Core interface for DNS server apps
- `IDnsAppRecordRequestHandler`: Handles DNS requests for APP records

This class initializes the database, services, and web interface, and processes DNS requests for dynamic DNS domains.

### 2. Models

- **User**: Stores user information, authentication data, and subscription details
- **DynamicDnsEntry**: Represents a dynamic DNS domain with its update token and IP addresses
- **ApiKey**: API keys for programmatic access to the service
- **PaymentTransaction**: Records of payment transactions
- **AppConfig**: Configuration settings for the application

### 3. Services

- **UserService**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management
- **DynamicDnsService**: Manages dynamic DNS entries and updates
- **PaymentService**: Processes payments and manages subscriptions using Stripe

### 4. Controllers

- **UserController**: API endpoints for user management
- **DynamicDnsController**: API endpoints for dynamic DNS operations
- **PaymentController**: API endpoints for payment processing and subscription management

### 5. Web Interface

A complete web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides:
- User registration and login
- Domain management
- API key management
- Subscription management
- Profile settings

## Integration with Technitium DNS Server

The app integrates with Technitium DNS Server through:

1. **APP Records**: The app processes DNS requests for configured APP records
2. **DNS Cache**: Updates the DNS server's cache when IP addresses change
3. **Zone Management**: Creates and updates DNS records in zones

## Deployment

To deploy this app:

1. Build the project using .NET 8.0 SDK
2. Copy the built files to the Technitium DNS Server Apps directory
3. Configure the app through the DNS server's web console
4. Create APP records in your zones to use the dynamic DNS service

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the future:

1. **DDNS Client**: A dedicated client application for automatic updates
2. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for user accounts
3. **Advanced DNS Features**: Support for additional record types and settings
4. **Reporting and Analytics**: Detailed statistics on DNS updates and usage
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Enhanced administration features
6. **Webhook Notifications**: Notifications for IP changes and other events
